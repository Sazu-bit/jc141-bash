## optional user inteface launchers list (which can be used with our releases easily)

- The page is a stub with more complete info to come.

- For any launcher, you can use [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) or otherwise [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to add banners to your library.

### [Rum](https://github.com/jc141x/rum)

Our own attempt at creating a single purpose launcher which focuses on interface and leaving the configuration to the bash script.

It remains usable but development has stalled due to no active developers.

#### [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris)

The releases can be added as 'Native' and selecting either start.w.sh or start.n.sh as the executable. (or otherwise however the script that starts the game is called)

Using it's implementation of wine falls out of our support.

Programming language: Python
